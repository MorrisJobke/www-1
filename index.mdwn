# user data manifesto

This manifesto aims at defining users’ fundamental rights to their own data in
the Internet age. People ought to be free and should not have to pay allegiance
to service providers. 

<ol start="0"><li>“User data” means any data uploaded by a user and/or
generated from a user, while using a service on the Internet. </li></ol>

Thus, users should have:

1. **Control** over user data access

    Data explicitly and willingly uploaded by a user should be under the
    ultimate control of the user. Users should be able to decide whom to grant
    (direct[^whydirect]) access to their data and with which permissions such
    access should be granted.

    Data received, generated, and/or collected from users’ activity while using
    the service (e.g. metadata or social graph data) should be made accessible
    to them and put under their control as well. If this control can’t be
    given, then this type of data should be anonymous or not stored for
    periods longer than necessary.

3. **Knowledge** of how the data is stored

    When the data is uploaded to a specific service provider, users should be
    informed about where that specific service provider stores the data, how
    long, in which jurisdiction the specific service provider operates, and
    which laws apply.

    Users should be free to choose to store their own data on devices (e.g.
    servers) in their vicinity and under their direct control. This way, users
    do not have to rely on centralised services.

4. **Freedom** to choose a platform

    Users should always be able to extract their data from the service at any
    time without experiencing any vendor lock-in.

    Open standards for formats and protocols are necessary to guarantee this.
    Programs under a Free Software license should be available for such formats
    and protocols.

<!--2. **Protection** from legal schemes

    When user data is governed by other laws regulating their flow (e.g.
    copyright, personal data protection), users should be protected from
    granting broad licenses catching rights that are not necessary for the
    operations on data.-->
