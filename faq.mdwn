1. what’s *not* user data?

User data is not necessarily private data and does not necessarily relate to a
person or contains personally identifiable information. Thus, this manifesto
does not aim at modifying personal data regulations, but rather aim at
complementing them.

Anonymously “dumped” data, e.g. on pastebin, or data that can be edited
directly by anybody, e.g. a public etherpad, do not usually deal with user
data.
