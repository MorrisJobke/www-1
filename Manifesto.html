<h1 id="user-data-manifesto">user data manifesto</h1>
<p>“User data” means any data submitted by or collected from a person using a service on the Internet, on which a user has power.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This manifesto aims at defining basic rights for people regarding their own data in the Internet age. Roughly, we refuse feudalism: people ought to be free and should not have to pay allegiance to service providers.</p>
<p>Thus, users should have:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Control over user data access</p>
<p>The data that the user uploads should be under control of this person. Users should be able to decide whom to grant direct access to their data and under which permissions.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Cryptography<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> is necessary to ensure this.</p></li>
<li><p>Knowledge of where the data is stored</p>
<p>When the data is uploaded to a specific storage provider, users should be able to know: where their data is stored, how long, in which country, and which laws apply.</p>
<p>It is recommended that all users have their own server in the long term and that users do not rely on centralised services. Use of peer-to-peer systems and unhosted apps are a means to that end.</p></li>
<li><p>Right to leave a platform</p>
<p>Users should always be able to extract their data at any time without being locked in to a specific service.</p>
<p>Open standards for formats and protocols, as well as access to the program under a Free Software license are necessary to achieve this.<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p></li>
</ol>
<p>If users have these, they are in control and can reasonably trust the services they use, rather than paying allegiance to the operator of a service.</p>
<p>When users control access to data they upload, it also applies to the operator of the service and to governments. Thus, a service should not force you to disclose private data (including private correspondence). That also means the right to use cryptography<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5">5</a></sup> should never be denied. Exceptions where the user of a service “forces” the user to give access to some user data to the service provider means data that is necessary for the service to perform the service.<sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Some services essentially allow users to submit data with the intention to make it publicly available for all. But even in these cases, some amount of user data is kept private. The user should have control over this data, e.g. by being able to refuse this data be stored and still be able to use the service. This usually applies to so-called “metadata” or to the social graph.</p>
<p>When users make data available to others, like a restrictive group of people or quite a large group, they should be able to decide under which permissions they grant access to this data. However, this right should not extend over others' rights to use the data once it has been made available to them. What's more, it does not mean that users should have the right to impose insane restrictions upon other people, like proprietary software. But this should be ultimately under the user's control, not under control of the operator of the service.</p>
<!--

I'm really not sure this is necessary:

Even then, there are possibly additional issues regarding control
over user data. One of the most important is when user data is
being stored by the operator of the service. In these cases,
another layer of complexity is added, especially regarding legal
issues.  Thus, when the user data is stored, users should be able
to know where it is, and which laws applies to it. Obviously, when
user data is made public, this requirement makes less sense. But
most of the time, this is actually imperative as a lot of services
dealing with user data are designed in a central fashion.

-->

<p>Ultimately, to ensure that user data is under the users' control rather than under control of a service operator, the best technical designs include peer-to-peer or distributed systems, and unhosted applications. In the long term, all users should have their own server.</p>
<p>But it is also important that users are not stuck into a specific technical solution, otherwise it might become a problem. This is why people should always be able to leave a platform. It means they should be able to have their data in an open format, be able to exchange information in an open protocol. Open standards are standards that are free of copyright and patent constraints. (A better definition http://fsfe.org/activities/os/def.html) Obviously, without the source code of the programs used to deal with user data, this is impractical. This is why programs should be distributed under a Free Software license.</p>

<p>FAQ:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>what's <em>not</em> user data?</li>
</ol>
<p>User data is not necessarily private data and does not necessarily relate to a person or contains personnally identifiable information. Thus, this manifesto does not aim at modifying personal data regulations, but rather aim at complementing them.</p>
<hr>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>[@Okhin suggested to focus on data &quot;created&quot; by the user rather than &quot;stored.&quot; While we try to say the same things (the bits are &quot;created&quot; by the user when he &quot;stores&quot;) it does not necessarily applies to all kinds of architectures. &quot;To store&quot; can be tricky to define. So I changed it to &quot;uploads&quot;]</p>
<p>The idea is that once data leaves the private sphere to enter the sphere of the web service, the manifesto should come into play. But this needsto be define thorougly too. I can think of 100 cases where data leaves my laptop. For instance let's take email. What is &quot;stored&quot;? An email goes through many different points before it gets &quot;stored&quot; - does that mean each point, not &quot;storing&quot; from a legal sense, wouldn't be concerned with the users' privacy? No. This is why we need to explain here that cryptography's needed to achieve #1.</p>
<p>So let's take email. When I send an email:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can say who should access my data (the To: and CC: fields)</li>
<li>and how (CC: / BCC:)</li>
</ul>
<p>What's important is that I can use GPG or other cryptographic tools to ensure that only the persons to which the data is aimed can read the email, etc. Of course, most people don't use cryptography, it's a problem, so ideally email providers should use cryptography (see https://g10code.com/steed.html for instance). On the other hand, some emails are really intended to be public or semi-public (lists, etc.) so mandatory use of cryptography would be a bit weird (except to sign). In any case, use of cryptography should NEVER be denied.</p>
<p>One issue is #1 is what happens when data is published and then the user wants to remove it. I think we should write something about the fact that this right to control access to user data is in no way an absolute right. This right is limited by other persons' rights. So if you give a person the right to access this data at one time, you cannot take away that right completely if that infringes on others' rights. We might want to clarify this in point #1.</p>
<p>Okhin also proposed to add:</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>Protect the data</p>
<p>User data must be protected from seizure and spying. Federating the data and encryption must be allowed to grant backup insurance and protection from eavesdropping.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But I feel that this is redundant with previous points. Seizure and spying is just one particular application of #1. Federation IMHO is a means to achieve #3. Encryption is already included, etc. But it might</p>
