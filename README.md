# user data manifesto

defining basic rights for people to control their own data in the
internet age

1. Control of user data access

    The data that someone stores should be under control of this
    person. Users should be able to decide whom to grant
    direct access and under which permissions to their data.

2. Know where the data is stored

    Users should be able to know: where their data is
    physically stored, how long, in what country, and what laws
    apply. It is recommended that each user have their own server
    in the long term.

3. Right to leave

    Users should always be able to extract and delete their
    data at any time without being locked in to a specific
    service.

    For this, open standards for formats and protocoles are
    a necessity.

    [?: For this, Free Software is a necessity.]

5. Protect the data from loss

    Everybody should be able to protect their data against
    surveillance and to federate their data for backups to prevent
    data loss or for any other reason.

    [?: should it be there?]

7.  Server software transparency

    Server software should be free software so that the source
    code of the software can be inspected to confirm that it works
    as specified.

    [?: I wonder whether this sould be here.]

Note: I think we should have less points. Ideally 4. The details
should then be laid out in explanations below the points. A little
bit like http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html
