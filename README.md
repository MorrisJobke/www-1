# user data manifesto

defining basic rights for people to control their own data in the
internet age

1. Control of user data

    The data that someone stores should be under control of this
    person. Everybody should be able to decide whom to grant
    direct access to their data.

2. Know where the data is stored

    Everybody should be able to know: where their data is
    physically stored, how long, in what country, and what laws
    apply. It is recommended to have a personal server for the
    user data in the long term.

3. Right to leave

    Everybody should always be able to extract and delete their
    data at any time without being locked in to a specific
    vendor's data format. 

4. Control access

    Everybody should be able to know, choose and control who has
    access to their data to see or modify it.

    <!-- â†‘ This is redundant with 1.  -->

5. Choose the conditions

    If someone let others access their data, then the user selects
    the license and conditions.

    <!-- I think this is alright.  The user data manifesto is not
    about copyright, etc. We all agree cpyright in its current
    state is alienating and that free software is good.  This
    sentence does not contradict that and does not make an apology
    for someone choosing to distribute proprietary software.  But
    I think that would be a mistake to have that argument here, it
    is not the goal.  This document does not focus on the
    behaviour of the user, it tries to give more freedom and
    rights to the user by giving responsibility and obligations to
    the service provider.  So let's not miss the goal and focus on
    that, instead of also trying to address different issues.  -->

6. Protect the data from loss

    Everybody should be able to protect their data against
    surveillance and to federate their data for backups to prevent
    data loss or for any other reason.

    <!-- I don't see how it is connected.  The backup and federation
    argument is redundant with 3.  -->

7.  Use it optimally

    Everybody should be able to access and use their data at all
    times with any device they choose and in the most convenient
    and easiest way for them.

    <!-- I wonder wether it is necessary to have that here.  -->

8.  Server software transparency

    Server software should be free software so that the source
    code of the software can be inspected to confirm that it works
    as specified.

    <!-- I still have problems with this point but right now I do
    not know exactly what to say about it.  -->
