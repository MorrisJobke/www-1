# user data manifesto 2.0

In 2012, Frank published the userdatamanifesto.org -- in 2014, a draft for
version 2 was published at http://userdatamanifesto.org/2.0 along with a wiki
at http://udm.branchable.com

We acknowledge that today, computers, networks and online services have
socially complex implications. The days where personal computing only happened
on personal computers are long gone (if they ever really existed).  This isn't
an excuse for accepting that our rights and freedom be violated. It behooves us
to demand freedom on the Internet and to refuse  feudalism. 

This is why we want to improve the User Data Manifesto to define the basic
rights all users of Internet and Web services ought to have.
