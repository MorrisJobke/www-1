“Data rights” are a new set of rights that people should have but  are not
recognised by law (yet).

They are unlike:

  - copyright, because data rights apply to *data* whereas copyright applies to
    “*works*” (typically, works of art).

  - data protection, because data rights apply for *the user* uploading
    data, not for *the person* who is the subject of the personally
    identifiable data.

    So data protection and data rights complement each others and some data is
    at the intersection of both of these rights.
