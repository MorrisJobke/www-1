Bruce Schneier. *The Battle for Power on the Internet* (extract):

> I have previously characterized this model of computing as "feudal." Users
> pledge their allegiance to more powerful companies who, in turn, promise to
> protect them from both sysadmin duties and security threats. It's a metaphor
> that's rich in history and in fiction, and a model that's increasingly
> permeating computing today.
> 
> Medieval feudalism evolved into a more balanced relationship in which lords
> had responsibilities as well as rights. Today's Internet feudalism is both
> ad-hoc and one-sided. Those in power have a lot of rights, but increasingly
> few responsibilities or limits. We need to rebalance this relationship. In
> medieval Europe, the rise of the centralized state and the rule of law
> provided the stability that feudalism lacked. The Magna Carta first forced
> responsibilities on governments and put humans on the long road toward
> government by the people and for the people. In addition to re-reigning in
> government power, we need similar restrictions on corporate power: a new
> Magna Carta focused on the institutions that abuse power in the 21st century.
> 
> Today's Internet is a fortuitous accident: a combination of an initial lack
> of commercial interests, government benign neglect, military requirements for
> survivability and resilience, and computer engineers building open systems
> that worked simply and easily.
> 
> We're at the beginning of some critical debates about the future of the
> Internet: the proper role of law enforcement, the character of ubiquitous
> surveillance, the collection and retention of our entire life's history, how
> automatic algorithms should judge us, government control over the Internet,
> cyberwar rules of engagement, national sovereignty on the Internet,
> limitations on the power of corporations over our data, the ramifications of
> information consumerism, and so on.
> 
> Data is the pollution problem of the information age. All computer processes
> produce it. It stays around. How we deal with it -- how we reuse and recycle
> it, who has access to it, how we dispose of it, and what laws regulate it --
> is central to how the information age functions. And I believe that just as
> we look back at the early decades of the industrial age and wonder how
> society could ignore pollution in their rush to build an industrial world,
> our grandchildren will look back at us during these early decades of the
> information age and judge us on how we dealt with the rebalancing of power
> resulting from all this new data.
